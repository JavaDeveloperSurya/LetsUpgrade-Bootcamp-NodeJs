Assignment 3: JSON Database & File Operations


- Create a simple JSON-based contact management system:
- Create a contacts.json file with an initial array containing 3 sample contacts (each with: id, name, email, phone)

Write a script that can:
- Read all contacts from the JSON file
- Display contacts in a formatted way
- Add a new contact to the JSON file
- Find and display a specific contact by name
- Delete a contact by id

After each operation, verify the changes by reading the updated file
Requirements:
- Use JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() appropriately
- Handle file operations synchronously
- Validate that the JSON structure is maintained
- Test all operations with sample data
